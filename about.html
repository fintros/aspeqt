<h1>AspeQt for Android.</h1> This software was tested on various Android devices running Lollipop (5.0.1), KitKat (4.4.2) and JellyBean (4.2.2).

Software command frame detection (SOFT - default handshake method) should work with anything @19200bps and is also behaving very nicely with non-standard speeds and Pokey divisor set eg. to 6 or 5.

Try it also with "use high speed executable loader" option turned on ;)

In this port a slightly modified and absolutely great <a href="https://github.com/greblus/usb-serial-for-android">usb-serial-for-android</a> driver is being used.

<b>SOFT command frame detection is now set as default method when AspeQt is started first time.</b>

Previous version with ftd2xx Java driver is still available <a href="https://github.com/greblus/aspeqt/tree/ftd2xx">here</a>.

<h1>Downloads</h1>

<b>AspeQt</b> is available through <a href="https://play.google.com/store/search?q=aspeqt">Google Play Store</a>.

All releases (including previous ones) are available <a href="https://github.com/greblus/aspeqt/releases">here</a>.

<b>Lastest compiled apk</b> is always <a href="https://github.com/greblus/aspeqt/raw/android/android/apk/aspeqt.apk">here</a>. And of course all apk files which were uploaded to android/apk can be found in the repo (there is a "Browse Files" button which will show you a snapshot of the repository at a time of the particular commit).

What doesn't work yet?

Loading atr files stalls occassionally in DSR handshaking mode. Haven't noticed it in SOFT mode. Hopefully Will fix it soon.
<h1>What's necessary to use it:</h1>

<ul>
	<li>Android device with USB Host Support. Check USB Host Support with this tool.</li>
  <li>OTG cable</li>.
  <li>Sio2PC-USB converter. I recommend <a href="http://lotharek.pl/product.php?pid=98">this one made by Lotharek</a>.</li>
<li>AspeQt for Android should work on anything starting from 3.1. I've tested it on Lark FreeMe 8" Android 4.2.2 tablet, Kazam 345 & Kazam Tornado phones with KitKat 4.4, Lenovo Tab 2 A10-70L and Lenovo
Tab 2 A7 tablets with Lollipop 5.0.1</li>
<li><b>No root necessary.</b></li>
<li><b>No drivers necessary.</b> usb-serial-for-android java driver is in the package.</li>
<li>After you connect the SIO2PC-USB to your Android device it'll automatically launch AspeQt. If you have SIO2PC-USB from Lotharek, select SOFT or DSR flow control method and set speed to 19200bps first, to see if it works at all. Feel free to experiment with higher speeds and Pokey divisors (HiSpeed OS, SDX or Qmeg is required for fast SIO routines).</li>
</ul>
Alternatively (on an unmodified Atari) it's enough to mount the folder with xex files and copy these two files: $boot.bin and picodos.sys which can be dowloaded <a href="https://github.com/greblus/aspeqt/tree/android/%24bootpic">from here</a>.


This way all xex files, e.g. just downloaded from the internet on your mobile or tablet) to some mounted folder eg. Download/Atari can be nicely loaded in high speed using MyPicoDos. All you have to do is to boot your Atari from this folder.

Speed greatly depends on your CPU possibilities and I/O performance, but Pokey divisor 6 works nicely on dual core 1.2GHz RK3066.

<h1>Summary</h1>

AspeQt emulates Atari SIO peripherals when connected to an Atari 8-bit computer with an SIO2PC cable. In that respect it's similar to programs like APE and Atari810. The main difference is that it's free (unlike APE) and it's cross-platform (unlike Atari810 and APE).
