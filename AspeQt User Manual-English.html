<p class="auto-style2"><strong>AspeQt User Manual</strong><br />
<p class="auto-style8"><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p><span class="auto-style1">AspeQt is a cross-platform, free and open source 
Atari 8-bit serial peripheral emulator. The name is an acronym for Atari serial 
peripheral emulator for Qt, Qt being the cross-platform application development 
framework used by AspeQt.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />

<span class="auto-style1">AspeQt emulates various Atari 8-bit peripherals like 
disk drives and printers via a SIO2PC cable. If you are familiar with software 
like SIO2PC, APE, Atari810, AtariSlO etc., you probably won’t have any problems 
getting used to AspeQt.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">Even though AspeQt is not fully mature yet, it is easy 
to use and, despite its shortcomings, has many features that you may find 
useful, the highlights being:</span><br class="auto-style1" />
</p>
<ul>
	<li><span class="auto-style1">Cross-platform GUI with Android support</span></li>
	<li class="auto-style1">6 emulated disk drives with support for 512 
	bytes per sector disk images</li>
	<li><span class="auto-style1">High speed operation up to 6 times faster than 
	the normal speed <em>(With compatible OS / DOS)</em></span></li>
	<li><span class="auto-style1">Ability to use PC folders as emulated disks</span></li>
	<li><span class="auto-style1">Disk image explorer for viewing and modifying 
	disk image contents</span></li>
	<li><span class="auto-style1">Ability to run Atari executables directly without 
	using disc images and Doses</span></li>
	<li><span class="auto-style1">Printer emulation with preview and ATASCII 
	support</span></li>
	<li><span class="auto-style1">Cassette image playback with custom baud rate</span></li>
	<li class="auto-style1">Ability to save and restore AspeQt sessions with its 
	UI settings.</li>
</ul>
<p class="auto-style8"><strong>System Requirements</strong></p>
<p><span class="auto-style1">AspeQt currently runs under Windows, Linux, Mac OS X and Android. 
Other Unix-like operating systems shouldn’t require too 
much effort. The absolute minimums aren’t easy to tell but a modern Linux 
distribution with Qt 5 libraries or a Windows XP (or newer) is recommended.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">Although AspeQt is reported to run on a Pentium 233 
MMX, a modem processor and a decent amount of RAM is strongly recommended for 
smooth operation. It runs fine on 64-bit CPUs.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">In order to do anything useful with AspeQt, you will 
need an Atari 8-bit computer and a SIO2PC cable. SIO2PC cable is an interface 
that connects the Atari’s serial bus to the PC’s serial port. Since many newer 
PCs lack a real serial port, you may need a UART card, or a high quality Serial-to-USB adapter
<em>(FTDI chip based devices were tested successfully, others 
may not work as intended)</em> or a SIO2PC USB interface <em>(instead of serial)</em>, If you 
opt for the later however, please note that the “AtariMax SIO2PC Universal 
Interface USB Edition” is not officially supported as it uses proprietary USB device 
drivers. </span></p>
<p><span class="auto-style1">You can get a RS232 or Serial-to-USB based SIO2PC cable from <a href="http://www.lotharek.pl/product.php?pid=98">Lotharek</a> or
<a href="http://www.atari8warez.com">Atari8Warez</a></span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">You don’t need any real Atari disk drives or printers 
to use AspeQt.</span></p>
<p class="auto-style8"><strong>Configuration</strong></p>
<p><span class="auto-style1">In order to be able to use AspeQt, you need to 
configure it to suit your hardware. When it’s running for the first time, a 
dialog will pop up asking you if you wish to open the configuration dialog. 
Click “Yes” to open the Options dialog. You can also access this dialog from the 
Tools/Options menu item.</span><br class="auto-style1" /><br>
<span class="auto-style4"><strong>Configuring the standard serial port backend</strong></span><br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">On Android usb-serial-for-android library is automatically finding and connecting 
to first available sio2pc-usb adapter with FTDI chip and AspeQt is launched right after usb OTG cable is connected.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">By default AspeQt on Android is using software command frame detection. It means that command frame is being found by the software without inspecting status of the command line.
Alternatively, you might select other handshaking method. 
The handshaking method tells AspeQt which one of the RS-232 pins is connected to 
Atari’s command line. There are 3 supported methods: RI, DSR, CTS and SOFT. Check your 
SIO2PC interface’s documentation to learn which one of them is used for your 
cable.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">The “High speed mode baud rate” combo box selects the 
transfer speed to be used for the high speed mode. Some OS /DOS for the Atari 
supports higher transfer speeds than the standard 19200 bits per second. Not all 
DOS /OS are capable of using 3x speed and some treat 2x as a special case for 
XF551 drives, so you may need some experimentation to find the best setting. 1x 
option is provided for unreliable connections, like when using a cheap USB 
adapter or when running AspeQt under virtualization software and/or on a slow 
CPU computer.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">If your serial port supports arbitrary bit rates, you 
may check the “Use non-standard” speeds check box and select a POKEY divisor to 
be used in high speed mode, the lower the divisor, the higher the speed. Usually 
real COM ports and some VCP<em> (Virtual COM Ports)</em> don't support arbitrary 
baud rates, FTDI chip based serial-to-USB cables do support arbitrary baud 
rates, and are thus the recommanded type of cable for use with AspeQt.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">The exact formula for the nominal speed is:</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">baudRate = clock/ (2*(divisor+7))</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">Where dock is ~1,773,447 for PAL, and ~1,789,772 for 
NTSC, however, it’s not always possible to reach nominal speeds. So, 1x is 
divisor 40, 2x is divisor 16 and 3x is divisor 8. Divisor 0 is ~l26kbits/second 
and that means approximately 6x.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">Please note that very few OS/DOS will be able to 
function with such high speeds. Currently the only tested software that can 
reach divisor 0 with AspeQt is the 
<a href="http://www.horus.com/~hias/atari/#hipatch">hisio OS patch</a>.&nbsp; As a final warning, some Atari 
8-bit computers have capacitors connected to their SIO lines that can interfere 
with high speed transfers. In short, speeds beyond 3x are not guaranteed to work 
in every case.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style4"><strong>Configuring AtariSIO backend</strong></span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1"><em>Note: AtariSIO is available under Linux only!</em></span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">After installing and running the AtariSIO module and 
making sure that you have the required permissions, you just need to enter a 
device name which should be /dev/atarisio0 under normal circumstances and select 
a handshaking method as described above for the standard serial port backend. 
Please refer to AtariSIO documentation on how to build and install AtariSIO.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
</p>
<p class="auto-style8"><strong>Usage</strong></p>
<p><span class="auto-style1">After making sure that you installed and configured 
AspeQt correctly, you can start using it with your Atari. If you used similar 
software before, it should be fairly straight forward.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style4"><strong>Disk images</strong></span><br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">Instead of using real disks, AspeQt uses disk images. 
These are regular files that contain an image of an Atari disk. There are 
several formats, the most common being the .atr format, currently AspeQt only 
supports .atr, .xfd,&nbsp; atx <em>(still in development),</em> and .pro&nbsp; formats. Future releases 
may provide support 
for .scp, .dcm, .di and gzipped (.atz. atr.gz, .xfz and .xfd.gz) formats.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">AspeQt emulates 6 disk drives. You have one 
slot for each of them, labeled D1 through&nbsp; D6 <em></em>.  
<br />
</em>You can mount a disk image to an empty drive slot by:</span></p>
<ul>
	<li><span class="auto-style1">Using the “Disk/Mount disk image” menu item 
	<em>(the first available slot will be used)</em></span></li>
	<li><span class="auto-style1">Using the “Mount disk image” tool button 
	available in each slot</span></li>
	<li><span class="auto-style1">Selecting a recently used disk image from the 
	“Disk” menu</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="auto-style1">You can see the result of your operation in the log 
display which is below the disk slots, if the operation is completed 
successfully, your Atari should be able to see the mounted disk image just like 
a real disk in a real drive.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" /><span class="auto-style1">You can use the tool buttons and context menu items to 
perform other operations like saving the disk image, enabling write protection 
for the image, reverting the image to its last saved state, ejecting 
(unmounting) the image, creating a new image and so on. You can also swap images 
using drag and drop.</span><br class="auto-style1" /><br class="auto-style1" />
<p><span class="auto-style4"><strong>Running Atari executables</strong></span><br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">Most Atari programs floating around on the internet come as 
Atari DOS executables. These files may have .exe, .com, .xex or any other 
extension. Instead of messing with disk image software and DOS, you may directly 
run these files in your Atari using AspeQt.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" /><span class="auto-style1">You can either drag and drop a file with .exe, com or 
.xex extension into any slot or you can use the menu item “File/Boot Atari 
executable” to access this feature. A dialog with the necessary instructions 
will pop up and the file will be loaded and run. You can leave the dialog open 
to boot from the same executable more than once. A reload button is provided 
which will reload the executable into memory. This button is intended for atari 
software developers who may be developing on the PC and testing their software 
after making changes to it. Reload button will ensure the most recent executable 
is loaded from the PC, and as such is mainly a convenience feature for such 
developers.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" /><span class="auto-style1">The executable booter has an optional high speed code 
which will allow you to load programs a lot faster. You can enable/disable it 
with the “Tools/Options/Emulation/Use high speed executable loader” check box. 
The high speed code is not able to cope with higher speeds than divisor 3 so 
check your configuration before attempting to load a file in this way.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" /><span class="auto-style1">Please note that this feature is not compatible with 
every executable and, in practice, it’s not even possible to implement such a 
loader. High speed loader has even more issues. So there will always be some 
programs that you won’t be able to run with the executable booter but hopefully 
the number of the compatibility problems will decrease with future versions of 
AspeQt.<br />
<br />
</span><br class="auto-style1" /><br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style4"><strong>Image explorer</strong></span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" /><span class="auto-style1"><em>Warning: This feature is 
constantly under development and may change with each release, so use it with 
caution.</em></span><em><br class="auto-style1" />
</em>
<br class="auto-style1" /><span class="auto-style1">As mentioned above, AspeQt uses disk images instead of 
real disks. These images may contain Atari files and it’s not always easy to 
extract them from an image or to add a file into an image. By clicking the 
‘Image properties’ tool button or by using the context menu, you can explore the 
files in a mounted disk image.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" /><span class="auto-style1">There are various file systems (ways of putting files 
in a disk) used by Atari. AspeQt supports the most common one, the Atari Dos 
file system (including the most used variants, like Dos 2.5 and MyDos) fully, 
including MyDos style subdirectories. It also has read-only support for 
SpartaDos file system. Other file systems (like Dos 3.0) are not supported at 
the moment.</span><br class="auto-style1" /><br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">By using the tool bar buttons in the image explorer, 
you can drag and drop, extract, add, delete Atari files with optional text 
conversion. You can also drag and drop files between different images and rename 
files by pressing F2 after selecting the name or extension of a file. You can 
print a directory of files by clicking on the printer button.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" /><span class="auto-style4"><strong>Cassette images</strong></span><br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">AspeQt can playback cassette images in .cas format. 
These are PC files that contain data extracted from an Atari cassette. You can 
either drag and drop a file with .cas extension into any slot or you can use the 
menu item “File/Playback cassette image” to access this feature. A dialog with 
the necessary instructions will pop up and the file will be played back.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" /><span class="auto-style1">The cassette emulator can be configured to ignore the 
baud rate that is embedded in the image file in favor of a custom one. This may 
speed up the load times but can cause compatibility problems. You can 
enable/disable it with the “Tools/Options/Emulation/Use custom baud rate for 
cassette emulation” check box. When enabled, you can use the spin box below to 
set the custom baud rate. The available values range from 425 through 875 bps. 
These values are the lowest and highest speeds that the Atari OS can process. 
The normal speed is 600 bps.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" /><span class="auto-style1">The cassette emulation does not support rewinding or 
seeking in the images. This may change in the future versions.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" /><span class="auto-style4"><strong>Printer output</strong></span><br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">AspeQt emulates a generic text-only Atari printer. It 
only emulates the first printer device, that is “P1:” You can view, save or 
print the emulated printer output using the “File/View printer text output”. 
Support for ASCII and ATASCII is provided.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" /><span class="auto-style4"><strong>Running multiple instances 
of AspeQt (Sessions)</strong></span><br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">AspeQt allows you to save and load your disk sessions, that 
is, the order and names of the mounted images and their settings. You can access 
this feature from the “File/Open session” and “File/Save session” menu items. 
</span>
<span class="auto-style6">As of version 0.8.2 AspeQt fully implements multi session capability</span><strong><span class="auto-style1">. </span>
</strong>
<span class="auto-style1">This means you can now launch multiple instances of AspeQt using different 
session files and have different configurations for each session.
This makes possible serving more than one Atari computer from one PC so long as 
you have more than one COM port and SIO2PC cable available. Simply create 
different sessions with different settings and save them to a permanent session 
file (a file with .aspeqt file extension).<br />
If you plan on serving more than one Atari computer simultaneously, make sure 
that the PC is fast enough to handle similtaneous SIO requests as Atari SIO is 
very time critical and can fail if the requests are not serviced in a timely 
fashion. Experiment with the multi-session capability and&nbsp; verify that it 
can be run reliably before you put it on serious use.<br />
<br />
The following parameters can be configured for individual sessions <em>(stored 
in each session file)</em></span></p>
